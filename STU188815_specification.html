        <h2><u>Provisional Site Structure:</u></h2>

        <h3>Wireframe</h3>
        <p>The image below shows how all of the pages can be reached from the main "About us" page. These links work back to the about us page, as well as to any of the other header pages. The wireframe also shows the links between these pages and the respective social media pages, which will open in a new tab by setting the target as blank. I will add a combination of picture links for the social media logos and hyperlinks whenever specific sites are mentioned.</p>
        
        <img src="images/wireframe.png" class='ignore' width="85%" height="auto" alt="wireframe">
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Header</h3></li>
            <p>a main site image/logo and multidirectional links to all of the pages, so that there is never a chance to be stuck on one page. </p>
            <li><h3>Home Page/About us</h3></li>
            <p>This page will feature a brief description of what Ardened Body & Mind offers, along with social media links towards the bottom of the page that open a seperate tab with the target="_blank" attribute.</p>
            <img src="images/aboutuspage.png" width="75%" height="auto"alt="about us page">
            <li><h3>Movement</h3></li>
            <p>The Movement page will feature a variety of photos of physical activity, along with a text description of what is on offer.</p>
            <img src="images/movementpage.png" width="75%" height="auto" alt="movement page">
            <li><h3>Mindfulness</h3></li>
            <p>The Mindfulness page will feature a variety of photos of relaxation techniques, along with a text description of what is on offer.</p>
            <img src="images/mindfulnesspage.png" width="75%" height="auto" alt="mindfulness page">
            <li><h3>Motivation</h3></li>
            <p>The motivation page will deliver a motivational quote to the site user when they press a button, and can feature as few or as many quotes as I decide to add. I need to learn how to stop cumulative repetition so that each quote is new, until they have seen them all.</p>
            <img src="images/motivationpage.png" width="75%" height="auto" alt="motivation page">
            <li><h3>Community</h3></li>
            <p>I want this to be a community forum page, but given the limitations of my knowledge in the integration of forums on a website I may have to settle for "imagined" external communities on social medias or perhaps just add a link to a non-existent forum.</p>
            <img src="images/communitypage.png" width="75%" height="auto" alt="community page">
            <li><h3>Opening Hours</h3></li>
            <p>The opening hours page will be a simple table, featuring days of the week in one column, opening time in a second column, and closing time in the third and final column. This page, too, will feature social media links, as I think it is important that if someone were to need access out-of-hours, they had another method of contact. </p>
            <img src="images/openinghourspage.png" width="75%" height="auto" alt="opening hours page">
             <li><h3>Contact</h3></li>
             <p>The contact page will feature a form, whereby users will have the opportunity to input their name, email, subject and message - and all sections will be validated. The submission of a message will then bring up a "Thank you" message to the user.</p>
             <img src="images/contactpage.png" width="75%" height="auto" alt="contact page">
             <img src="images/contactpage2.png" width="75%" height="auto" alt="contact page 2">
             <li><h3>External Social Media Pages</h3></li>
             <p>Without creating specific social media pages for Ardened Body & Mind for each of the four chosen social medias (Facebook, X, Youtube, Instagram), I will not be able to link it directly to a real website, so I have decided i will link to the homepage of each social media, in leiu of a "real" page. I will take advantage of the target="_blank" attribute so that following the link doesn't get rid of the Ardened page, as the main goal of my website is to have all links and buttons working properly, or as properly as they can given the limitations of not having a real business social media etc. </p>

            <div>
            <img src="images/yogainternationallogo.jpeg" width="25%" height="auto" alt="Yoga International Logo">
            <li><h3><u>Yoga International</u></h3></li>
            <h4>Design:</h4>
            <p>Initial thoughts are that they jump straight into pricing, and though they do offer a free trial of 7 days, it shouldn't be the first thing you see when arriving at their website.
                The "Sign In"/"Get Started" buttons on the top right are effective as they catch the eye and are easily visible.</p>
            <h4>Pricing:</h4>
            <p>Monthly: £14.99, Annually: £145</p>
            <h4>Accessibility/Useability:</h4>
            <p>Quite an extensive front page, meaning you have a long way to scroll all the way down to the bottom to see everything. Could benefit from some header navigation rather than footer navigation so that users can get to the part of the website they are interested in straight away.</p>
            <h4>Reviews:</h4>
            <p>3.8/5 on Trustpilot (3727 reviews) </p>
            <h4>Features:</h4>
                <p>Email capture</p>
                <p>Sign in page</p>
                <p>Custom workouts based on users available time</p>
                <p>Guided meditations based on users available time</p>
                <p>Free trial</p>
                <p>Phone application (integration with Apple Health)</p>
                <p>Blog article library</p>

                 <li><h3><u>Headspace</u></h3></li>
                 <h4>Design:</h4>
                 <p>Similarly designed landing page, straight to pricing which I think can be a bit offputting. They do, however, have a much more clear navigation bar in the header, giving options for plans etc. There is also a drop down menu in the header offering articles & resources, meditation, sleep, mindfulness and mental health which is a great touch as the user can be easily guided to whichever resource is most applicable to them. Simple logos and cartoonish design is friendly and very on-brand in terms of putting the user at ease.</p>
                 <h4>Pricing:</h4>
                 <p>Monthly: £9.99, Annually: £49.99</p>
                 <h4>Accessibility/Useability:</h4>
                 <p>Much more accessible than the Yoga International page, navigation in the header and even a drop down menu mean the user is never searching for too long to find where they need to be.
                    Very little to see without membership.

                 <p>1.6/5 on Trustpilot (572 reviews) ((their own website boasts 4.9 stars, but i cant seem to find where))</p>

                        <h4>Design:</h4>
                        <p>Upon entering the website, an email collection pop-up appears offering 30 days free. When you close it you see the main page, offering the same deal but with a excercise video compilation in the background. Further down there are reviews/testimonials from websites and magazines in a horizontal scroll. A brief description of their wide range of workouts/routines. Social media hyperlinked logos in the footer. Login link in the header. Simplistic logo, modern looking website. </p>
                        <h4>Pricing:</h4>
                        <p>Monthly: $8.99-$10.49, Annually: $65.99 - $89.99</p>
                        <h4>Accessibility/Useability:</h4>
                        <p>Without taking advantage of their free month deal, there is very little available to see on their website, except potential excercise classes and reviews. Intermittent pop up in bottom right corner every time a new member joins, stating that they have joined and where they are from. Email newsletter at the bottom of the page.

                            <p>No pop-ups upon opening page, which makes a nice distinction from the others so far. Great navigation bar, showing guidance to whichever page the user wants to see. That same navigation bar is available on all pages so users can go back and forth with ease. Social media hyperlinked logos in the top left for ease of access to follow relevant socials. Sign up/log in on the top right of the header, along with basket which is linked to the "Shop" section. Email collection for newsletter at the bottom of the page, along with an opt-in for emails and sms messages. Contact address, phone number, email address. More aimed at getting kids outside/active, but as our demographic is wide it is still useful to explore their feaures.</p>
                            <h4>Pricing:</h4>

                                <p>Quite plain, nothing eyecatching - being asked "Are you over 45?" on the homepage is limiting to their demographic.
                                    Good use of theme colours, matching logo etc. Click down navigation menu, with a website that is aiming at an older demographic you would expect navigation to be clearly presented.

                                <h4>Accessibility/Useability:</h4>
                                <p>Website is accessible, but given their demographic some of the navigation seems unneccesarily hidden. In the payment window the text is grey on grey, making actually purchasing a contract or service difficult if you aren't tech savvy or have vision impairment.</p>

                                    <h4>Design:</h4>
                                    <p>Clean and simple, reads like a magazine. Aimed at a predominantly middle-aged, female demographic. Use of pink and white in keeping with the logo. Easily visible navigation, with both header navigation and a click down scroll menu. </p>
                                    <h4>Pricing:</h4>
                                    <p>Free - revenue from advertising? </p>
                                    <h4>Accessibility/Useability:</h4>
                                    <p>The navigation having both header and scroll box make it accessible on both desktop and mobile. Text is bright and readable. Search bar in the header also good for navigation.</p>
                                    <p>"Travel" section leads to a "404, Whoops, the page you are looking for doesn't exist!", but on the plus side it then says "Why not try one of our stories below!" and offers other articles.</p>
                                    <h4>Reviews:</h4>
                                    <p>No Trustpilot reviews, and as far as i can see no testimonials on their website.</p>
